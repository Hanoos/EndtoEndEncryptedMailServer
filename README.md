# Description

Secure (reasonably) host your own e-mail accounts, as e-mail was originally designed to work!

Let's make ourselves more independent from corporations, from others minding our own business, and most important, re-gain control of our personal communication over the web, in this case specifically over e-mail.

Yes, those electronic mail boxes that others maintain for us, the technical infrastucture that give us this ability to comunicate instantly with everyone all over the planet, this last revision of what long ago was smoke messages, or carrier pigeons, through the centuries of postal systems, till the actual technology, where we do have, now, nor knowledge or control about every part of the entire mechanism, but hey, they give it to us for free!!!

So

Corporations and governments read and/or store all our emails, plus, we can't even complain about it anymore (from august 2013), and that doesn't mean necessary "spying" until it eventually became that.
 
And if you're ok with it, then you don't need this tutorial

But in case you are not, good news, i'm going to explain here how to set up an End-to-end encrypted ([E2EE](https://ssd.eff.org/en/glossary/end-end-encryption)) email server, and hosting it in your personal server at home.
I'm assuming here you know how to configure a reasonably secure server at home, but if you don't, you can check my [Raspbian Secure Server Config Tutorial](https://github.com/d3cod3/raspbian-server) first.
